  Latest iteration of my led matrix driver core. I'm currently doing a complete rewrite of the zynq software, so only the HDL here for the time being. My previous version was able to refresh a 128x32 panel( 24 bit color ) at over 900Hz. This version functions in the simulator, but has not been tested on hardware.
  
  
  Raytraced G-Man from HL1, rendering two camera angles at a little over 350hz.

  Next release will include support for the ARM A9's Neon FPU, allowing for fast vectorized floating point operations.
